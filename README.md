# Functions and Complexity

This project demonstrates fundamental linear algebra functions, implemented from scratch in Python, and compares their performance against optimized NumPy implementations. Each function includes an analysis of its time complexity using Big O notation.
Each function is annotated with its time complexity to highlight its performance in terms of input size.

The project includes a timing comparison between the manual implementations and NumPy's optimized versions. For each function, the execution time in nanoseconds is recorded and compared, demonstrating the efficiency gains from using NumPy.

A logistic regression model is implemented as an application example, using both manual Python functions and NumPy for efficiency. The logistic regression model is trained on a synthetic 2D dataset, and the wall time for each approach is measured to highlight the performance advantages of NumPy in machine learning.
